[] Add author(could just search from the backend) and recipe desc
[] Add community to every navbar
[] Add a field to check if it is a public or private recipe
[] Add a field to set visibility of the recipes
[] Add a field for recipe desc to:
    [] create frontend
    [] create backend
    [] view frontend
    [] view backend
    [] viewPage frontend 
    [] viewpage backend 

[] Add a 'bookmark' or 'save' feature for recipes <-- need to set up the community page and include the author for the viewPage
[] Maybe add a feature that would allow users to "fork" or copy recipes from others to allow them to make edits



[] make a base.html page for stuff like the navbar then extend from it in other code
[] Integrate the recipe scraper to the website 
[] Add a way to insert images of the recipes
