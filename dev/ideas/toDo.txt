[] Add a filter to the View page to filter by tags.
    [] FIGURE OUT WHY THE HELL VIEW AINT WORKING
[] Design the community page on Figma (will only be possible after finishing most of the ideas here)
[] Add a 'bookmark' or 'save' feature for recipes
[] Add a way to insert images of the recipes 
[] Add a way to add notes to saved recipes  (if the idea below about forking/copying doesnt go through)
[] Maybe add a feature that would allow users to "fork" or copy recipes from others to allow them to make edits
[] Integrate the recipe scraper to the website 
[] I have added the option to insert files for the create page, and have settled the backend for inserting to the collection
    but still need to find a way to present the files when viewing and when editing. Check 'Recipe Tagging Options' on chatGPT
    [] have settled for viewRecipe and its backend. Need to settle:
        [] editPage + backend
        [] viewPublicRecipe + backend
